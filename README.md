# Advent of Code 2018 #

Solutions for the 2018 edition of the Advent of Code - http://adventofcode.com/2018

Back again for another year, the little [Advent of Code] site that has a new pair of problems to solve each new day (i.e., midnight Eastern time) and this repository holds my solutions using [ruby](http://ruby-lang.org)

There are a few files that help with the mechanics of the challenge itself. The value for the `session` cookie from the site is stored in the `./.session` file. The `day_prep.rb` retrieves the challenge description and builds the initial solution file using the `day_template.rb`. The input for the day's challenge is retrieved (and cached!) using code from the module defined in `input.rb`.

* My solutions for the original 2015 installment of the Advent of Code is in the repo: [rab/adventofcode2015](https://github.com/rab/adventofcode2015)
* My solutions for the 2016 installment of the Advent of Code is in the repo: [rab/adventofcode2016](https://github.com/rab/adventofcode2016)
* My solutions for the 2017 installment of the Advent of Code is in the repo: [rab/adventofcode2017](https://github.com/rab/adventofcode2017)
