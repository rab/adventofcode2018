# --- Day 6: Chronal Coordinates ---
#
# The device on your wrist beeps several times, and once again you feel like you're falling.
#
# "Situation critical," the device announces. "Destination indeterminate. Chronal interference
# detected. Please specify new target coordinates."
#
# The device then produces a list of coordinates (your puzzle input). Are they places it thinks
# are safe or dangerous? It recommends you check manual page 729. The Elves did not give you a
# manual.
#
# If they're dangerous, maybe you can minimize the danger by finding the coordinate that gives the
# largest distance from the other points.
#
# Using only the Manhattan distance, determine the area around each coordinate by counting the
# number of integer X,Y locations that are closest to that coordinate (and aren't tied in distance
# to any other coordinate).
#
# Your goal is to find the size of the largest area that isn't infinite. For example, consider the
# following list of coordinates:
#
# 1, 1
# 1, 6
# 8, 3
# 3, 4
# 5, 5
# 8, 9
#
# If we name these coordinates A through F, we can draw them on a grid, putting 0,0 at the top left:
#
# ..........
# .A........
# ..........
# ........C.
# ...D......
# .....E....
# .B........
# ..........
# ..........
# ........F.
#
# This view is partial - the actual grid extends infinitely in all directions.  Using the
# Manhattan distance, each location's closest coordinate can be determined, shown here in
# lowercase:
#
# aaaaa.cccc
# aAaaa.cccc
# aaaddecccc
# aadddeccCc
# ..dDdeeccc
# bb.deEeecc
# bBb.eeee..
# bbb.eeefff
# bbb.eeffff
# bbb.ffffFf
#
# Locations shown as . are equally far from two or more coordinates, and so they don't count as
# being closest to any.
#
# In this example, the areas of coordinates A, B, C, and F are infinite - while not shown here,
# their areas extend forever outside the visible grid. However, the areas of coordinates D and E
# are finite: D is closest to 9 locations, and E is closest to 17 (both including the coordinate's
# location itself).  Therefore, in this example, the size of the largest area is 17.
#
# What is the size of the largest area that isn't infinite?

# --- Part Two ---
#
# On the other hand, if the coordinates are safe, maybe the best you can do is try to find a
# region near as many coordinates as possible.
#
# For example, suppose you want the sum of the Manhattan distance to all of the coordinates to be
# less than 32. For each location, add up the distances to all of the given coordinates; if the
# total of those distances is less than 32, that location is within the desired region. Using the
# same coordinates as above, the resulting region looks like this:

# ..........
# .A........
# ..........
# ...###..C.
# ..#D###...
# ..###E#...
# .B.###....
# ..........
# ..........
# ........F.
#
# In particular, consider the highlighted location 4,3 located at the top middle of the
# region. Its calculation is as follows, where abs() is the absolute value function:
#
# Distance to coordinate A: abs(4-1) + abs(3-1) =  5
# Distance to coordinate B: abs(4-1) + abs(3-6) =  6
# Distance to coordinate C: abs(4-8) + abs(3-3) =  4
# Distance to coordinate D: abs(4-3) + abs(3-4) =  2
# Distance to coordinate E: abs(4-5) + abs(3-5) =  3
# Distance to coordinate F: abs(4-8) + abs(3-9) = 10
#
# Total distance: 5 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 10 = 30
#
# Because the total distance to all coordinates (30) is less than 32, the location is within the
# region.
#
# This region, which also includes coordinates D and E, has a total size of 16.
#
# Your actual region will need to be much larger than this example, though, instead including all
# locations with a total distance of less than 10000.
#
# What is the size of the region containing all locations which have a total distance to all given
# coordinates of less than 10000?
