# --- Day 9: Marble Mania ---
#
# You talk to the Elves while you wait for your navigation system to initialize. To pass the time,
# they introduce you to their favorite marble game.
#
# The Elves play this game by taking turns arranging the marbles in a circle according to very
# particular rules. The marbles are numbered starting with 0 and increasing by 1 until every
# marble has a number.
#
# First, the marble numbered 0 is placed in the circle. At this point, while it contains only a
# single marble, it is still a circle: the marble is both clockwise from itself and
# counter-clockwise from itself. This marble is designated the current marble.
#
# Then, each Elf takes a turn placing the lowest-numbered remaining marble into the circle between
# the marbles that are 1 and 2 marbles clockwise of the current marble. (When the circle is large
# enough, this means that there is one marble between the marble that was just placed and the
# current marble.) The marble that was just placed then becomes the current marble.
#
# However, if the marble that is about to be placed has a number which is a multiple of 23,
# something entirely different happens. First, the current player keeps the marble they would have
# placed, adding it to their score. In addition, the marble 7 marbles counter-clockwise from the
# current marble is removed from the circle and also added to the current player's score. The
# marble located immediately clockwise of the marble that was removed becomes the new current
# marble.
#
# For example, suppose there are 9 players. After the marble with value 0 is placed in the middle,
# each player (shown in square brackets) takes a turn. The result of each of those turns would
# produce circles of marbles like this, where clockwise is to the right and the resulting current
# marble is in parentheses:
#
# [-] (0)
# [1]  0 (1)
# [2]  0 (2) 1
# [3]  0  2  1 (3)
# [4]  0 (4) 2  1  3
# [5]  0  4  2 (5) 1  3
# [6]  0  4  2  5  1 (6) 3
# [7]  0  4  2  5  1  6  3 (7)
# [8]  0 (8) 4  2  5  1  6  3  7

# The goal is to be the player with the highest score after the last marble is used up. Assuming
# the example above ends after the marble numbered 25, the winning score is 23+9=32 (because
# player 5 kept marble 23 and removed marble 9, while no other player got any points in this very
# short example game).
#
# Here are a few more examples:
#
# 10 players; last marble is worth 1618 points: high score is 8317
# 13 players; last marble is worth 7999 points: high score is 146373
# 17 players; last marble is worth 1104 points: high score is 2764
# 21 players; last marble is worth 6111 points: high score is 54718
# 30 players; last marble is worth 5807 points: high score is 37305
#
# What is the winning Elf's score?
